# Telemetry-Based Health Monitoring & Cost Impact Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates a telemetry-driven health monitoring system inspired by
aerospace, aviation, satellite, and industrial infrastructure environments.

The solution simulates sensor telemetry data, detects anomalies using machine learning,
analyzes time-series degradation trends, and quantifies the financial impact of
preventive maintenance versus unplanned failures.

## Problem Statement
In mission-critical systems such as aircraft, satellites, ports, and smart buildings,
equipment failures are rare but extremely costly.
Traditional reactive maintenance leads to downtime, operational disruption, and
high emergency repair costs.

## Solution Approach
- Simulated telemetry data (temperature, vibration, voltage)
- Time-series trend analysis to detect degradation
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- Cost-of-failure vs preventive maintenance analysis
- Business-driven recommendations

## Key Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest)

## Key Insights
- Gradual degradation trends can be detected before failure
- Anomaly frequency is a strong indicator of operational risk
- Preventive maintenance driven by telemetry can significantly reduce costs

## Industry Relevance
This approach is directly applicable to:
- Aircraft health monitoring (Airbus-style systems)
- Satellite telemetry & fault detection
- Maritime engines and port equipment
- Smart buildings (HVAC, BMS)
- Industrial IoT systems

## Outcome
Telemetry-driven analytics enable proactive decision-making,
reduced downtime, and measurable cost savings in critical infrastructure systems.
